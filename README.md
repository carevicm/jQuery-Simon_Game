Simon Game
Description:
The Simon game is a memory-enhancing game where players must reproduce a sequence of colors presented to them. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging, testing the player's memory and reflexes.

How to Play:

The game starts by illuminating one of the color buttons and producing a corresponding tone.
The player must then press the same button.
In the next round, the game adds another color to the sequence, and the player must reproduce the sequence from the beginning.
With each successful round, an additional step is appended to the sequence.
The game continues until the player makes an error, at which point the game will reset.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used to structure the content of the game.
CSS: Applied to stylize the game interface, providing an engaging and modern design.
JavaScript (with jQuery): Powers the game's interactivity, handling player input, game logic, and visual/audio feedback.
Features:

Responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes.
Smooth animations and sound effects for an immersive experience.
Progressive difficulty, challenging players more as they advance.
